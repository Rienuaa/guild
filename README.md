# The Adventurer's Guild!
An incremental, made by Ellen Cantor, using the ideas from Mogworld, by Yahtzee Crosshaw.

Whew, what a mouthful.

This is an incremental game that uses a series of buildings to produce and move around units in a large machine. It will take some time to understand the idea behind it, but I hope you enjoy it nonetheless!
