The Adventurer's Guild!
Based off of the book Mogworld by Yahtzee Crosshaw

Your end goal is to gain GOLD. You spend gold on adventuring amenities,
and to buy monopolies and licenses to run in certain areas. Gold is the
primary resource. There are also ADVENTURERS, which you buy that pay dues
in GOLD to you. There is also the resource AGENTS, which refers to the 
agents that work for the guild. You also accrue INFLUENCE in certain areas,
which can be spent to buy special bonuses for the adventurers in the area.

 GUILD HOUSES -> INFLUENCE 
 
 You start with 10 gold, and one button option - to buy a single guild
 house. This gives you a trickle of 1g/s and the ability to hire adventurers
 in the area.
